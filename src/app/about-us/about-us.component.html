                <p>It all began in 1967, in a small two-room office in central Stockholm. Two brothers, Jonas and Robert af Jochnick, and their friend, Bengt Hellsten, sat down and talked about their dreams. They wanted to create a different kind of company that offered a different kind of product. They came up with the idea of giving people the opportunity to benefit from high quality beauty products inspired by our Swedish nature. At the time, this was not an obvious road to success – especially not in Sweden. But that conversation marked the beginning of an incredible journey that continues to inspire more than 50 years later.</p>
                <p>Today Oriflame is present in over 60 markets with over 3 million independent Beauty Consultants who share, promote and sell our beauty and wellness products.</p>
